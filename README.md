# PGA Tour Analytics: What Really Wins Golf Tournaments?

Turns out, it's not how far you drive, it's how well you approach the green.

# What's This All About?
I dug into 5 years of PGA Tour data to answer one simple question: **what actually makes a golfer successful?** 

Spoiler: It's not what you think. While everyone obsesses over driving distance, I discovered that **approach shots** and **putting** have way more impact on earnings and wins.

# What I Discovered

# Money Talks
- **Power Hitters** earn 25% more than accuracy players
- **Top 10%** of players make 2x the average tour pro
- **Strokes Gained: Approach** has the highest correlation with earnings (not driving distance!)

# Player Personalities
- **Power Hitters**: Long off the tee, less accurate
- **Accuracy Players**: Fairway finders, consistent
- **Iron Specialists**: Magic with their mid-irons
- **Putting Wizards**: Can drain putts from anywhere

# Career Insights
- Most players peak around years 3-5 on tour
- Consistency matters more than occasional brilliance
- Improvement is possible at any career stage
